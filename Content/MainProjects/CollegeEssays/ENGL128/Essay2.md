# Introduction

Charles Darwin was known as the largest contributor to evolutionary biology. Through his various works, ideas such as natural selection ("survival of the fittest"), mutation, and descendant from common ancestors became the foundation of much of our understanding of biology and shaped how we interpret the beginning of humanity and life as we know it. However, it is vital to understand the context behind his works because the entirety of Darwin's life from 1809 to 1882 was during the time imperialism, particularly British imperialism, was at its strongest. It can be said that Darwin was influenced by the biggest part of the 19<sup>th</sup> century: colonialism. It can also be said that Darwin might have influenced the motivation for imperialism and colonialism through either the language Darwin used to describe his findings or ways people might interpret his findings as justification for such. Using *On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life* (hereby shortened to *On the Origin of Species*) as our example, we shall explore the concepts of the "struggle for existence" and natural selection and how some details of his work may suggest arguments for justification for British imperialism and colonialism, from which we shall then infer the relationship between Darwinism and the 19<sup>th</sup> century's ideals.

Natural selection and the "struggle for existence" are two topics which Darwin wrote extensively in *On the Origin of Species*; chapter III is about what he calls the "struggle for existence", and chapter IV is about natural selection (or "the survival of the fittest").

# The Struggle for Existence

The struggle for existence, in Darwin's mind, is what drives species to change in so many ways to the point where groups of species or "distinct genera" arises. So-called "varieties", no matter how small or slight and no matter what their causes are, "will generally be inherited by the offspring". This is part of the effort to preserve the species, because due to the inheritance of varieties, "the offspring, also, will thus have a better chance of surviving, for, of the many individuals of any species which are periodically born, but a small number can survive." The natural kingdom -- different from how people usually look at it as peaceful, calm, quiet, etc. -- is a dangerous place where every species must fight for survival and every individual within the same species must fight for its own survival, even though we cannot really see it. Not only that, every individual of a species as well as every species much obtain "success in leaving progeny." The factors which affect the struggle for existence (and natural selection) are vast and complex, and Darwin provided many examples in chapter III. For example, in section *Nature of the Checks to Increase*, Darwin listed some factors -- namely food abundance, (most importantly) climate, and disease -- which serve to be what keep population size of a particular species in check.

> "When a species, owing to highly favourable circumstances, increases inordinately in numbers in a small tract, epidemics […] often ensue. […] On the other hand, in may chase, a large stock of individuals of the same species, relative to the number of its enemies, is absolutely necessary for its preservation."

Other checks also come into play when it comes to the struggle for existence across and between all species of animals and plants, some of which may happen during specific times in a year or be more potent than others. This struggle can result in drastic changes in a relatively short period of time; two examples given by Darwin are the fact that "when an American forest is cut down, a very different vegetation springs up" and the fact that "ancient Indian ruins in the Southern United States, which must formerly have been cleared of trees, now display the same beautiful diversity and proportion of kinds as in the surrounding virgin forests." In Darwin's view, these examples demonstrated the result of struggles between various species which had lasted for centuries.

Darwin also stated,

> "In the case of varieties of the same species, the struggle will generally be almost equally severe, and we sometimes see the contest soon decided. […] As the species of the same genus usually have, though by no means invariably, much similarity in habits and constitution, and always in structure, **the struggle will generally be more severe between them, if they come into competition with each other, than between the species of distinct genera.**"
>
> Charles Darwin, *On the Origin of Species*, 1859

Within a particular environment, varieties between members of the same species give some members an advantage compared to the rest, and this in turn allow these individuals to dominate the environment and thus destroy the rest, even though they are all the same species.

# Natural Selection and "Survival of the Fittest"

Because of the way the struggle for life and existence occurs and remains, the survival of the fittest is of utmost importance, and thus nature has its own ways to select individuals of any species and allow them to live, hence the term natural selection. However, contrary to contemporary belief (and even our current belief), the term natural selection does not imply conscious choice (i.e., by a divine entity). The idea of natural selection is the aggregated result of multiple complex factors; any slight physical change like climate. Furthermore,

> "We have good reason to believe […] that changes in the conditions of life give a tendency to increased variability; and in the foregoing cases the conditions the changed, and this would manifestly be favourable to natural selection, **by affording a better chance of the occurrence of profitable variations.** Unless such occur, natural selection can do nothing."
>
> Charles Darwin, *On the Origin of Species*, 1859

According to Darwin, "natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinising, throughout the world, the slightest variations; rejecting those that are bad, reserving and adding up all that are good; silently and insensibly working, WHENEVER AND WHEREVER OPPORTUNITY OFFERS, at the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life." This process is slow, but it is nonetheless very real. Through natural selection, the young generation of a species is modified to gain a chance of survival better than that of its parent generation, thus benefitting the species as a whole. Darwin demonstrated the great effectiveness of natural selection and how it works extensively in the section *Illustration of the Action of Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest* in Chapter IV.

Darwin also went over conditions in which "new forms" of species may be produced via natural selection in section *Circumstances Favourable for the Production of New Forms through Natural Selection*, which he deemed "an extremely intricate subject." Darwin stated that a vast number of factors can greatly change the outcome of natural selection, and that a large group of individuals with a set of advantages may be given a better chance of survival at the expense of lesser amount of variability. However,

> "Though nature grants long period of time for the work of natural selection, she does not grant an indefinite period; **for as all organic beings are striving to seize on each place in the economy of nature, if any one species does not become modified and improved in a corresponding degree with its competitors it will be exterminated.** Unless favourable variations by inherited by some at least of the offspring, nothing can be effected by natural selection."
>
> Charles Darwin, *On the Origin of Species*, 1859

Lastly, Darwin stated that because natural selection acts solely through the preservation of variations in some way advantageous, rarity becomes a precursor to extinction. If there is not enough number of individuals of a species, that species will eventually die out and become extinct. In the process of natural selection, divergence and diversification occurs.

# Implications from Darwinism

As stated earlier, Charles Darwin lived his entire life in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, an era where imperialism and colonialism were at their peak. By the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Britain successfully captured for herself land in virtually every time zone. At the time, Britain was "the empire on which the sun never sets" literally because the sun always shone somewhere on the British Empire around the globe. Of course, several other nations like France and Spain were also colonising territories, but none of those came as close as Britain did. Thus, Britain has the most power on the world's stage. Reasonably for them, there must be even more reason to continue colonising territories and nations.

This may come as a surprise to some people: When *On the Origin of Species* were published in 1859, Darwinism was in fact widely accepted (i.e., it was not fought against by certain factions unlike today). In fact, outside biology, Darwinism was adapted to be a social, political, and economic theory collectively known as Social Darwinism. According to *Encyclopaedia Britannica*,

> "Social Darwinism, the theory that human groups and races are subject to the same laws of natural selection as Charles Darwin perceived in plants and animals in nature. According to the theory, which was popular in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, **the weak were diminished and their cultures delimited while the strong grew in power and cultural influence over the weak.** Social Darwinists held that **the life of humans in society was a struggle for existence ruled by 'survival of the fittest,'** a phrase proposed by the British philosopher and scientist Herbert Spencer."
>
> The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, *Social Darwinism*, 2023

Another notable detail is the fact that in *On The Origin of Species*, Darwin borrowed the term "survival of the fittest" by sociologist Herbert Spencer and the term "struggle for existence" from economist Thomas Malthus. However, according to *HISTORY*,

> "Darwin rarely commented on the social implications of his theories. But to those who followed Spencer and Malthus, Darwin’s theory appeared to be confirming with science what they already believed to be true about human society -- **that the fit inherited qualities such as industriousness and the ability to accumulate wealth, while the unfit were innately lazy and stupid.**"
>
> History.com Editors, *Social Darwinism*, 2018

Hence, social Darwinism were applied in concepts such as laissez-faire capitalism, political conservatism, class stratification (justified based on the "natural" inequality among individuals), and eugenics. These ideas were considered offshoots of Darwinism because they used Darwinism more as a justification than as a working theory. In fact, by looking at the quote above, we can already see how Darwinsim might have been used as an argument to justify imperialism and colonialism: "Surely, it must be upon Great Britain’s responsibility to 'civilise' 'lower' people around the world and make them 'industrious'; at the same time, she should and must accumulate wealth from the labour of these poor 'lower' people because they are definitely not above *us, the British*!" That may be an argument somebody had made back in the 19<sup>th</sup> century in defence of colonialism, as he might also believe that it was a moral duty to colonise and civilise. "Competition must be a good thing because that is what happens in nature, and what makes humans separate from the natural world?", someone might ask.

> "At the societal level, social Darwinism was used as a philosophical rationalization for imperialist, colonialist, and racist policies, sustaining belief in Anglo-Saxon or Aryan cultural and biological superiority,"
>
> The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, *Social Darwinism*, 2023

thus justifying British imperialism and colonialism even further. Indeed, imperialism and colonialism as a concept did not end until the 20<sup>th</sup> century.

What also eventually died out in the 20<sup>th</sup> century is social Darwinism as a concept, because over time, we have gained more knowledge in biological, societal, and cultural phenomena and behaviours, and such knowledge increasingly undermined (rather than supported) the premises of social Darwinism. Regardless, the effect of Darwinism was undeniable, as it had left an impact on the way we thought about conquest and social structure for quite some time.

# Conclusion

Whenever Darwinism is mentioned, people tend to think of how much some factions and groups are against it. People tend to also think only of the purely biological implications of evolution when it comes to foundational concepts like natural selection. However, it should be vital for us to understand the cultural implications of Darwinism and the works of Charles Darwin. Any body of text -- especially the most influential ones -- can be used either for societal and cultural progress or to justify atrocities. We can only say something is bad because at some point in history, we finally realised that it is indeed a bad thing; for example, imperialism used to be justified, but now we keep condemning it because we as humans have collectively known better.
